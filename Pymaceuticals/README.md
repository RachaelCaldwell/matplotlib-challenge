# matplotlib-challenge
The Module 5 Challenge uses Matplotlib to generate tables and figures needed for the technical report of a skin cancer clinical study for Pymaceuticals Inc.
In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The following data visualizations were created:
* Summary Statistics DataFrame
* Bar Plot displaying the total number of timepoints for all mice tested for each drug regimen throughout the course of the study.
* Pie Chart displaying the gender distribution of mice in the study.
* Box Plot displaying the final tumor volume for four specific treatment regimens.
* Line Plot displaying the tumor volume versus the timepoint for Capomulin treatment of mouse 1509.
* Scatter Plot displaying the tumor volume versus mouse wieght for the entire Capomulin regimen.
* Linear Regression Model displaying the relationship between mouse weight and average tumor volume for the Capomulin treatment.
