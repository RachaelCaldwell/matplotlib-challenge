The Module 5 Challenge uses Matplotlib to generate tables and figures needed for the technical report of a skin cancer clinical study for Pymaceuticals Inc.
In this study, 249 mice identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The following data visualizations were created:
**Summary Statistics DataFrame**
